# Design-Villa

This application is a collaborative project made by the Google Udacity Android Basics Scholars.

**Design Villa** is what we'd like to call the **Layout Designer App**. The app shall present the user with a list of different kinds of UI snapshots. A user can choose a layout and see it's corresponding XML code. Since the audience for the app would be Android Basics Scholars, the UI screenshots will be categorized as follows:
* Single Screen Apps
* Just Java Apps
* Court Counter Apps
* Quiz Apps
* Miscellaneous
