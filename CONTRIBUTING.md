:+1: :tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute :tada: :+1:

For any discussions, queries or clarifications, reach out to any of the project moderators or post a message on the slack channel #cp_desgn_app. Your suggestions :mag_right: and feedback :memo: are always welcome.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Design Villa project.

* Add comments to your code as per the standards.
* Avoid using hardcoded values.
* Ensure that you run `Reformat` and `Rearrange` code often.
* Commit significant logical changes separately rather than commiting all the changes at once.
* Use the present tense in your commit messages ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* When raising a PR, specify your `commit number` and a title. Add details about the changes in the description.
* Add a screenshot or an animated GIF in the PR description whenever applicable.
* Make sure your repo is always in sync with the base repo. Make sure you're always working on the latest code to avoid merge conflicts.
* Check for any merge conflicts when raising a PR. If you see one and you are not sure how to resolve, reach out to us on the slack channel.
* Ensure you're always making the changes in the relevant branch that will be specified in the channel announcements. Pull requests to a different branch will not be accepted.

We look forward to your participation and your valuable contributions. Thank you! :tada:
